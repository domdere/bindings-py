# bindings-py [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/domdere/bindings-py.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/domdere/bindings-py)

Low Level Bindings for the Python C API

(Still in development)

## Building the project

The project must be "configured" at least once everytime `bindings-py.cabal` changes, this can be done with:

    cabal configure

If you wish to run the unit tests you will have to run:

    cabal configure --enable-tests

Then finally build it with:

    cabal build

See `cabal build --help` for more build options.

## Running Unit Tests

**After** running `cabal build`, you can run the unit tests with the command:

    cabal test

## Adding Unit tests

Unit tests are written with [**doctest**] [doctest-github], for instructions on how to add unit tests 
see the **doctest** [**User Guide**] [doctest-userguide].

Currently only files in the `src/` directory are searched for tests, it is assumed that the code in `main/`
is a thin layer of code that uses modules from `src/`.
